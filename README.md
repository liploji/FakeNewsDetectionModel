# FakeNewsDetectionModel
A Fake News Detection Model that uses Tessaract Optical Character Recognition and Natural Language Processing
paired with Logistic Regression.
The model uses Optical Character Recognition on an image and it extracts the text found in the image. 
It would then use the extracted text  in the Natural Language Processing and Logistic Regression added in the model. 
It would determine whether the image is fake or not based on the data that is being used as a reference.
