# FakeNewsDetectionModel
A Fake News Detection Model that uses Tessaract Optical Character Recognition and Natural Language Processing
with Logistic Regression.
The model uses Optical Character Recognition on a image that has text and it extracts the text found in the image
and uploads it in the Natural Language Processing added in the model to determine whether the image is fake or not.
